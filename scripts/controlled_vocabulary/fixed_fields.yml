study:
  description: A Study is a container for a sequencing investigation that may comprise multiple experiments. The Study has an overall goal, but is otherwise minimally defined in the SRA.  A Study is composed of a descriptor, zero or more experiments, and zero or more analyses. The submitter may decorate the Study with web links and properties.
