"Mandatory. Unique identificator for each sample. This is used to link experiments to the samples."	"Mandatory. Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting."	"Mandatory. Free-form text describing the sample, its origin, and its method of isolation."	"Mandatory. Describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sample was derived"	"Recommended. Geographical coordinates of the location where the specimen was collected"	"Optional. Name of persons or institute who collected the specimen"	"Mandatory. The date of sampling, either as an instance (single point in time) or interval. In case no exact time is available, the date/time can be right truncated i.e. all of these are valid iso8601 compliant times: 2008-01-23t19:23:10+00:00; 2008-01-23t19:23:10; 2008-01-23; 2008-01; 2008."	"Mandatory. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the country or sea. Country or sea names should be chosen from the insdc country list (http://insdc.org/country.html)."	"Optional. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the specific region name followed by the locality name."	"Optional. Name of the expert who identified the specimen taxonomically"	"Optional. Identifies sequences derived by direct molecular isolation from a bulk environmental dna sample (by pcr with or without subsequent cloning of the product, dgge, or other anonymous methods) with no reliable identification of the source organism"	"Optional. Mating type of the organism from which the sequence was obtained; mating type is used for prokaryotes, and for eukaryotes that undergo meiosis without sexually dimorphic gametes"	"Mandatory. Health status of the host at the time of sample collection."	"Optional. Scientific name of the laboratory host used to propagate the source organism from which the sample was obtained"	"Mandatory. Scientific name of the natural (as opposed to laboratory) host to the organism from which sample was obtained."	"Optional. Identifier for the biological material from which the sample was obtained, with optional institution code and collection code for the place where it is currently stored."	"Optional. Institution code and identifier for the culture from which the sample was obtained, with optional collection code."	"Optional. Unique identifier that references the physical specimen that remains after the sequence has been obtained and that ideally exists in a curated collection."	"Mandatory. Individual isolate from which the sample was obtained"	"Optional. Name of sub-species of organism from which sample was obtained"	"Optional. Name or identifier of a genetically or otherwise modified strain from which sample was obtained, derived from a parental strain (which should be annotated in the strain field; sub_strain from which sample was obtained"	"Recommended. Serological variety of a species (usually a prokaryote) characterized by its antigenic properties"	"Recommended. Name of the strain from which the sample was obtained."
