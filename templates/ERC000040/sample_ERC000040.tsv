"Mandatory. Unique identificator for each sample. This is used to link experiments to the samples."	"Mandatory. Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting."	"Mandatory. Free-form text describing the sample, its origin, and its method of isolation."	"Optional. Sample_protocol_size-fraction_lower-threshold_(µm) indicates the lower size threshold. Materials smaller than the size threshold are excluded from the sample. Example: 0.22 µm"	"Optional. Sample_protocol_size-fraction_upper-threshold_(µm) indicates the upper size threshold. Materials larger than the size threshold are excluded from the sample.example: 1.6 µm"	"Mandatory. Targeted gene or locus name for marker gene studies"	"Mandatory. Name of subfragment of a gene or locus. Important to e.g. identify special regions on marker genes like v6 on 16s rrna"	"Mandatory. Pcr primers that were used to amplify the sequence of the targeted gene, locus or subfragment. This field should contain all the primers used for a single pcr reaction if multiple forward or reverse primers are present in a single pcr reaction. The primer sequence should be reported in uppercase letters"	"Optional. Describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sample was derived"	"Optional. Name of persons or institute who collected the specimen"	"Mandatory. The date of sampling, either as an instance (single point in time) or interval. In case no exact time is available, the date/time can be right truncated i.e. all of these are valid iso8601 compliant times: 2008-01-23t19:23:10+00:00; 2008-01-23t19:23:10; 2008-01-23; 2008-01; 2008."	"Optional. The altitude of the sample is the vertical distance between earth's surface above sea level and the sampled position in the air.. Units: m"	"Mandatory. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the country or sea. Country or sea names should be chosen from the insdc country list (http://insdc.org/country.html)."	"Mandatory. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by latitude and longitude. The values should be reported in decimal degrees and in wgs84 system. Units: dd"	"Mandatory. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by latitude and longitude. The values should be reported in decimal degrees and in wgs84 system. Units: dd"	"Optional. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the specific region name followed by the locality name."	"Optional. Depth is defined as the vertical distance below surface, e.g. for sediment or soil samples depth is measured from sediment or soil surface, respectivly. Depth can be reported as an interval for subsurface samples.. Units: m"	"Mandatory. Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf types, plant spacing, and other factors like climate. Biome should be treated as the descriptor of the broad ecological context of a sample. Examples include: desert, taiga, deciduous woodland, or coral reef. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Mandatory. Environmental feature level includes geographic environmental features. Compared to biome, feature is a descriptor of the more local environment. Examples include: harbor, cliff, or lake. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Mandatory. The environmental material level refers to the material that was displaced by the sample, or material in which a sample was embedded, prior to the sampling event. Environmental material terms are generally mass nouns. Examples include: air, soil, or water. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Optional. The method or deviced employed for collecting the sample"	"Mandatory. Identifies sequences derived by direct molecular isolation from a bulk environmental dna sample (by pcr with or without subsequent cloning of the product, dgge, or other anonymous methods) with no reliable identification of the source organism"	"Optional. Salinity of water at the time of taking the sample. Format: ##.#, Sdn:p02::psal, sdn:p06::ugkg for psu. Example: 39.1 psu.. Units: psu"	"Optional. Reference details related to a sample in form of an uri."
