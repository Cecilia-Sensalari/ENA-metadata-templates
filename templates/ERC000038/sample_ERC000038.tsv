"Mandatory. Unique identificator for each sample. This is used to link experiments to the samples."	"Mandatory. Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting."	"Mandatory. Free-form text describing the sample, its origin, and its method of isolation."	"Mandatory. Date and time in utc when the sampling event started and ended, e.g. each ctd cast, net tow, or bucket collection is a distinct event. Format: yyyy-mm-ddthh:mm:ssz. Example: 2013-06-21t14:05:00z/2013-06-21t14:46:00z."	"Mandatory. Latitude of the location where the sampling event started, e.g. each ctd cast, net tow, or bucket collection is a distinct event. Format: ##.####, Decimal degrees; north= +, south= -; use wgs 84 for gps data. Example: -24.6666.. Units: dd"	"Mandatory. Longitude of the location where the sampling event started, e.g. each ctd cast, net tow, or bucket collection is a distinct event. Format: ###.####, Decimal degrees; east= +, west= -; use wgs 84 for gps data. Example: -096.1012.. Units: dd"	"Mandatory. The distance below the surface of the water at which a measurement was made or a sample was collected. Format: ####.##, Positive below the sea surface. Sdn:p06:46:ulaa for m. Example: 14.71. Units: m"	"Optional. The sampling device(s) used for the event. Example: ctd(sbe9c)/rosette with niskin bottles."	"Mandatory. Identifies the protocol used to produce the sample, e.g. filtration and preservation. Example: bact_nuc_w0.22-1.6."	"Mandatory. Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf types, plant spacing, and other factors like climate. Biome should be treated as the descriptor of the broad ecological context of a sample. Examples include: desert, taiga, deciduous woodland, or coral reef. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Mandatory. Environmental feature level includes geographic environmental features. Compared to biome, feature is a descriptor of the more local environment. Examples include: harbor, cliff, or lake. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Mandatory. The environmental material level refers to the material that was displaced by the sample, or material in which a sample was embedded, prior to the sampling event. Environmental material terms are generally mass nouns. Examples include: air, soil, or water. Envo (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: www.environmentontology.org/browse-envo"	"Mandatory. Refers to a finite or indefinite activity aiming at collecting data/samples, e.g. a cruise, a time series, a mesocosm experiment. Example: tara_20110401z."	"Mandatory.

Explain how and for how long the soil sample was stored before dna extraction."	"Optional. Health status of the subject at the time of sample collection"	"Optional. List of diseases with which the subject has been diagnosed at the time of sample collection; can include multiple diagnoses; the value of the field depends on subject; e.g. Charcoal rot (macrophomina phaseolina), late wilt (cephalosporium maydis)"	"Recommended. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the marine region name chosen from the marine regions vocabulary at http://www.marineregions.org/. Example: aegean sea."	"Mandatory. Classification of the seabed where the organism has been found; for european seabed habitats please use terms from http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats-code-browser.jsp; example: b3.4 : soft sea-cliffs, often vegetated"	"Mandatory. Age of the organism the sample was derived from."	"Mandatory. Origin of stock and raised conditions"	"Mandatory. Total weight of shellfish including shell at the time of sampling. Epifauna and epiphytes to be removed.. Units: g"	"Mandatory. Total weight of all soft tissue, i.e. weight of entire organism without shell, at the time of sampling. Units: g"	"Mandatory. Length of shell (perpendicular to the hinge). Units: g"	"Mandatory. Width of shell (perpendicular angle to length). Units: g"	"Recommended. Total weight of striated muscle and smooth muscle.
