Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting."	"Mandatory.
