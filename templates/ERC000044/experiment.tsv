"Mandatory. Unique identificator for each experiment. This is used to link runs to experiments."	"Optional. Short text that can be used to call out experiment records in searches or in displays. This element is technically optional but should be used for all new records."	"Mandatory. Identifies the parent study. (From study metadata)"	"Mandatory. (From sample metadata)"	"Optional. Goal and setup of the individual library including library was constructed."	"Optional. The submitter's name for this library."	"Mandatory. Sequencing technique intended for this library."	"Mandatory. The LIBRARY_SOURCE specifies the type of source material that is being sequenced."	"Mandatory. Method used to enrich the target in the sequence library preparation"	"LIBRARY_LAYOUT specifies whether to expect single, paired, or other configuration of reads. In the case of paired reads, information about the relative distance and orientation is specified."	"Optional. Insert size for paired reads"	"Optional. Free form text describing the protocol by which the sequencing library was constructed."	"Mandatory. The PLATFORM record selects which sequencing platform and platform-specific runtime parameters. This will be determined by the Center. Optional if 'instrument_model' is provided."	"Mandatory. Model of the sequencing instrument."
