The age class or life stage of the organism at the time of collection."	"Mandatory. Name of the project within which the sequencing was organized"	"Optional. A tolid (tree of life id) is a unique and easy to communicate sample identifier that provides species recognition, differentiates between specimen of the same species and adds taxonomic context. Tolids are endorsed by the earthbiogenome project (ebp) and should be assigned to any sample with association to the ebp. More information at id.tol.sanger.ac.uk."	"Optional. Center where dna barcoding was/will be performed."	"Mandatory. Name of persons or institute who collected the specimen"	"Mandatory.

Depth is defined as the vertical distance below surface, e.g. for sediment or soil samples depth is measured from sediment or soil surface, respectivly. Depth can be reported as an interval for subsurface samples.. Units: m"	"Optional. The elevation of the sampling site as measured by the vertical distance from mean sea level.. Units: m"	"Mandatory.
