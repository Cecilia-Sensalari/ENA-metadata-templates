    cv: []
    description: A block or batch is an experimental unit arrangement into a group
      which is similar to one another. Typically, a blocking factor is a source of
      variability that is not of primary interest to the experimenter. An example
      of a blocking factor might be the sex of a patient; by blocking on sex, this
      source of variability is controlled for, thus leading to greater accuracy (EFO_0005067).

  description: A Study is a container for a sequencing investigation that may comprise
    multiple experiments. The Study has an overall goal, but is otherwise minimally
    defined in the SRA.  A Study is composed of a descriptor, zero or more experiments,
    and zero or more analyses. The submitter may decorate the Study with web links
    and properties.
