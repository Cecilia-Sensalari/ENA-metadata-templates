## Description of the metadata fields

### Study

| field name | requirement | description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| alias | Mandatory | Unique identificator for a study. This is used to link experiments to the study. |
| title | Mandatory | Title of the study as would be used in a publication. |
| study_type | Mandatory | The STUDY_TYPE presents a controlled vocabulary for expressing the overall purpose of the study. |
| new_study_type | Optional if ‘study_type’ is not ‘other’ | To propose a new term, select Other and enter a new study type. |
| study_abstract | Optional | Briefly describes the goals, purpose, and scope of the Study.  This need not be listed if it can be inherited from a referenced publication. |


### Experiment

| field name | requirement | description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| alias | Mandatory | Unique identificator for each experiment. This is used to link runs to experiments. |
| title | Optional | Short text that can be used to call out experiment records in searches or in displays. This element is technically optional but should be used for all new records. |
| study_alias | Mandatory | Identifies the parent study. (From study metadata) |
| sample_alias | Mandatory | (From sample metadata) |
| design_description | Optional | Goal and setup of the individual library including library was constructed. |
| library_name | Optional | The submitter's name for this library. |
| library_strategy | Mandatory | Sequencing technique intended for this library. |
| library_source | Mandatory | The LIBRARY_SOURCE specifies the type of source material that is being sequenced. |
| library_selection | Mandatory | Method used to enrich the target in the sequence library preparation |
| library_layout | Mandatory | LIBRARY_LAYOUT specifies whether to expect single, paired, or other configuration of reads. In the case of paired reads, information about the relative distance and orientation is specified. |
| insert_size | Optional | Insert size for paired reads |
| library_construction_protocol | Optional | Free form text describing the protocol by which the sequencing library was constructed. |
| platform | Mandatory | The PLATFORM record selects which sequencing platform and platform-specific runtime parameters. This will be determined by the Center. Optional if 'instrument_model' is provided. |
| instrument_model | Mandatory | Model of the sequencing instrument. |


### Run

| field name | requirement | description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| alias | Mandatory | Unique identificator for each run. |
| experiment_alias | Mandatory | From_experiment_metadata |
| file_name | Mandatory | The name or relative pathname of a run data file. |
| file_format | Mandatory | The run data file model. |



### Sample (this checklist)
| field name | requirement | description |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| alias | Mandatory | Unique identificator for each sample. This is used to link experiments to the samples. |
| title | Mandatory | Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays. |
| scientific_name | Mandatory | Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting. |
| sample_description | Mandatory | Free-form text describing the sample, its origin, and its method of isolation. |
