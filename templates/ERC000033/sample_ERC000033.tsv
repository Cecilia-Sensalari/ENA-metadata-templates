Short text that can be used to call out sample records in search results or in displays."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of sample that distinguishes its taxonomy.  Please use a name or synonym that is tracked in the INSDC Taxonomy database. Also, this field can be used to confirm the TAXON_ID setting."	"Mandatory. Free-form text describing the sample, its origin, and its method of isolation."	"Optional. Exposure of the subject to infected human or animals, such as poultry, wild bird or swine. If multiple exposures are applicable, please state them separated by semicolon. Example: poultry; wild bird"	"Optional. Duration of the exposure of the subject to an infected human or animal. If multiple exposures are applicable, please state their duration in the same order in which you reported the exposure in the field 'subject exposure'. Example: 1 day; 0.33 days"	"Optional. Setting within which the subject is exposed to animals, such as farm, slaughterhouse, food preparation. If multiple exposures are applicable, please state their type in the same order in which you reported the exposure in the field 'subject exposure'. Example: backyard flock; confined animal feeding operation"	"Optional. Use of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, during any type of exposure. Example: mask"	"Optional. Was the subject confined to a hospital as a result of virus infection or problems occurring secondary to virus infection?"	"Optional. The number of days the illness lasted. Example: 4"	"Optional. The symptoms that have been reported in relation to the illness, such as cough, diarrhea, fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, nausea, runny_nose, shortness_of_breath, sore_throat. If multiple exposures are applicable, please state them separated by semicolon."	"Recommended. The date of sampling, either as an instance (single point in time) or interval. In case no exact time is available, the date/time can be right truncated i.e. all of these are valid iso8601 compliant times: 2008-01-23t19:23:10+00:00; 2008-01-23t19:23:10; 2008-01-23; 2008-01; 2008."	"Mandatory. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the country or sea. Country or sea names should be chosen from the insdc country list (http://insdc.org/country.html)."	"Recommended. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by latitude and longitude. The values should be reported in decimal degrees and in wgs84 system. Units: dd"	"Recommended. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by latitude and longitude. The values should be reported in decimal degrees and in wgs84 system. Units: dd"	"Recommended. The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the specific region name followed by the locality name."	"Recommended. Reason for the sample collection."	"Recommended. Disease outcome in the host."	"Mandatory. Common name of the host, e.g. human"	"Mandatory. A unique identifier by which each subject can be referred to, de-identified, e.g. #131"	"Recommended. Age of host at the time of sampling; relevant scale depends on species and study, e.g. could be seconds for amoebae or centuries for trees. Units: centuries, days, decades, hours, minutes, months, seconds, weeks, years"	"Mandatory. Health status of the host at the time of sample collection."	"Mandatory. Gender or sex of the host."	"Mandatory. Scientific name of the natural (as opposed to laboratory) host to the organism from which sample was obtained."	"Recommended. Unique laboratory identifier assigned to the virus by the investigator. Strain name is not sufficient since it might not be unique due to various passsages of the same virus. Format: up to 50 alphanumeric characters"	"Mandatory. Name of the person who collected the specimen. Example: john smith"	"Mandatory. Name of the institution to which the person collecting the specimen belongs. Format: institute name, institute address"	"Recommended. Date on which the sample was received. Format:yyyy-mm-dd. Please provide the highest precision possible. If the sample was received by the institution and not collected, the 'receipt date' must be provided instead. Either the 'collection date' or 'receipt date' must be provided. If available, provide both dates."	"Optional. Conditions at which sample was stored, usually storage temperature, duration and location"	"Recommended. The cut off value used by an investigatior in determining that a sample was seropositive."	"Recommended. Serological variety of a species characterised by its antigenic properties. For influenza, ha subtype should be the letter h followed by a number between 1-16 unless novel subtype is identified and the na subtype should be the letter n followed by a number between 1-9 unless novel subtype is identified. If only one of the subtypes have been tested then use the format h5nx or hxn1. Example: h1n1"	"Mandatory. Individual isolate from which the sample was obtained"	"Optional.

Describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sample was derived. Example: soil"
